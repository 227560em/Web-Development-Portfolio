 <h1>Free Boss Baby from Other Babies!</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Unfortunately, one of Boss Baby's former colleagues betrayed him and pushed him into a dump of babies. By now, he has been bottled, changed and travelled most of the way on the tredmill. Your mission is to guess Boss Baby's number tag before it is too late.   </p>

  <p>You only have <strong>10 guesses and limited time</strong> (You will be alerted every 10 seconds).</p>

<p>If you can't guess the correct number tag by then, Boss Baby will be stuck with all of the unowned babies <strong>FOREVER</strong>.</p>
